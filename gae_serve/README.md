## Introduction

This is a simple sample that shows how to:

- Create a GAE service that loads a pickled sci-kit learn model from GCS, and use it to serve prediction requests through Cloud Endpoints.


[comment]: #(get Andrew to help set these up as the advanced usage section)
The benefits of this configuration include:

1. GAE's autoscaling and load balancing.
1. Cloud Endpoints' monitoring and access control.


## Requirements

A GCP project that has GAE, GCS, and Cloud Endpoints enabled.
